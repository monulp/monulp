### 🕶️ Code, Conquer, Secure 🕶️

Greetings, digital wanderers! I'm Adil Monu, a cybersecurity professional on a mission to safeguard the invisible. As a relentless hunter of vulnerabilities, I thrive in the hidden spaces where data, systems, and humans intersect.

From **penetration testing** to **incident response**, I craft solutions to keep digital ecosystems resilient. My journey is fueled by curiosity and a touch of digital rebellion – because security isn’t just a profession; it’s a philosophy. 

When I'm not busy dissecting packets or fortifying networks, I’m sharing insights, building security tools, and creating fun, accessible cyber challenges for all levels.

#### 🌌 In my world:
- 🧠 **Threats are puzzles** waiting to be solved.
- 🛡️ **Defense is an art** that evolves daily.
- 🔍 **Every byte has a story** – I’m here to uncover it.

Stay curious, stay secure – and remember, the only secure system is a vigilant one.
